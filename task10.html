function y(){
for(var i=1;i<6;i++){ 
setTimeout(() => console.log(i ), i * 1000)//it willprint 6 for 5 times after 1 sec because of clourse here i is pointed to the referace 
//when the this function is run on seconde time the var i value will be 6 and as we know js will not wait anything thats byt it will print 6 again and again because the value store in the memory 
//and when its come to i so it will print 6 
//it happes because of i because each copy of the function spotted the same storage of i this i become 6 because the loop is continues running 
//by that time the cb function to get a chance to execute by the time the value of i has been  because of loop 6
//here we can solve this problem over here  why this happed how to fix this ----- very quick to fix this to use let over here let has a block scope 
//each and every foop iteration when the loop run every time this i  is a new  variable all togeather each time set time is run 
// this cb function has the new copy of i with it its has own copy (that means the function teated as a variable or every time it will new variable or fresh variable save it ) and it will make 5 copy of each and every function 
//below is the example of this 
}

// interviewer asked you how can i print 1,2,3,45,with out let so you just create a funcion which behave like clouser
//example
